      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our web services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect information to provide better services to all our users. We collect information in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information you give us. For example, our services require you to sign up for an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number, or credit card.</li>
        <li>Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or view and interact with our ads and content.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We use the information we collect from all our services to provide, maintain, protect, and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Information We Share</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of our company unless one of the following circumstances applies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>With your consent. We will share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of our company when we have your consent to do so.</li>
        <li>For legal reasons. We will share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of our company if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
          <ul>
            <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.</li>
            <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Information Security</h2>
      <p>
        We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</li>
        <li>We offer you two-step verification when you access your account.</li>
        <li>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
